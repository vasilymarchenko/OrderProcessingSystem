### Test Stage 3: RabbitMQ Integration
### Make sure OrderService is running: dotnet run (from OrderService folder)
### And RabbitMQ is running: docker ps (check for rabbitmq container)

### Create Order - Should publish message to RabbitMQ
POST http://localhost:5255/api/orders
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "customerEmail": "test@example.com",
  "items": [
    {
      "productCode": "PROD-001",
      "quantity": 2
    }
  ]
}

### Get Order by ID (replace {orderId} with actual ID from previous response)
GET http://localhost:5255/api/orders/{orderId}

###
### After creating an order:
### 1. Check RabbitMQ Management UI: http://localhost:15672 (guest/guest)
### 2. Go to "Exchanges" tab
### 3. Look for exchange named "orders"
### 4. Click on it and check the message count
### 5. You should see the message was published with routing key "order.placed"
###
